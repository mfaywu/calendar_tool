# calendar_tool

I've wanted to make a calendar tool for a while that analyses my time. 
When better to start than the night before my last final of winter quarter?

Ideally, I want to spend brain energy on different items proportional to their priority. 
However, time is much easier to measure than brain energy, so for now I will assume that brain energy = time.


TO DO
* Put events into categories based on title or colour
* Customization? ^
* Deal with overlapping events
* Display total time
* Display unaccounted for time
* Display time in different categories
* These are all for one day first

* Create graphical display
* Long term trends

Goal: Hopefully use this data to make educated predictions on how much time items will take me and use data to decide whether or not to add a new task.
